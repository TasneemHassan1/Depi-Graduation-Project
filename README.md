# Human Resources Dataset Analysis

📌 **Project Description**

This project provides a structured Human Resources (HR) data analysis workflow.
It guides the process of understanding, cleaning, preparing, and analyzing HR datasets to extract meaningful insights about employees’ education, performance ratings, and job satisfaction.

The analysis aims to answer key HR questions such as:

- Does education level influence performance?
- How does job satisfaction vary across employees?
- What are the main factors driving retention and promotion?

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Understanding**
   - Identify available files and variables.
   - Define variable types: numerical, categorical, or textual.
   - Detect relationships across files (e.g., EmployeeID).

2. **Initial Data Exploration**
   - Preview rows and dataset dimensions.
   - Inspect data types.
   - Detect missing or abnormal values.

3. **Data Merging**
   - Combine multiple HR files using common keys.
   - Ensure no duplicates remain after merging.

4. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values (remove or impute).
   - Standardize column names.
   - Fix incorrect data types.
   - Remove duplicate rows.

5. **Data Preparation**
   - Create new calculated columns.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Address outliers if necessary.

6. **Descriptive Analysis**
   - Compute summary statistics (mean, median, min, max).
   - Analyze distributions of education, satisfaction, and performance.
   - Count employees by category or group.

7. **Analytical Questions**
   - Explore correlations between satisfaction and performance.
   - Compare performance across education levels.
   - Investigate links between rating, promotion, and retention.

8. **Data Visualization**
   - Build charts: bar, pie, histograms, and line charts.
   - Compare variables visually for better understanding.

9. **Insights & Findings**
   - Summarize patterns in education, performance, and satisfaction.
   - Highlight key HR takeaways.

10. **Recommendations**
    - Suggest improvements for employee engagement and performance.
    - Provide HR-driven action points.
