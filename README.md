# Social Issues in Egypt Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes social issues in Egypt using various datasets. The aim is to understand the relationships between education, health, and other social factors, and to provide insights that can inform policies and interventions.

## Analytical Workflow

1. **Data Understanding**
   - Identify all available files and their content.
   - Determine variable types (numerical, categorical, textual).
   - Define potential relationships between files (e.g., Governorate and Year as keys).

2. **Initial Data Exploration**
   - Display first few rows of each file.
   - Check number of rows and columns.
   - Inspect data types for each column.
   - Detect missing or abnormal values.

3. **Data Merging**
   - Identify common columns (Governorate, Year, Age Group).
   - Merge files into a unified DataFrame when appropriate.
   - Ensure no duplicates after merging.

4. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values (remove or impute).
   - Standardize column names.
   - Convert incorrect data types (e.g., strings → numbers).
   - Remove duplicate rows.

5. **Data Preparation**
   - Create new columns if needed (e.g., rates, percentages).
   - Encode categorical variables numerically.
   - Handle outliers that affect accuracy.

6. **Descriptive Analysis**
   - Calculate mean, median, min, max for key variables.
   - Analyze distribution of education (literacy) levels.
   - Examine incidence of health issues, begging, addiction, and divorce.
   - Count records by category or group (Governorate, Year, Age Group).

7. **Analytical Questions**
   - Investigate correlations between variables (e.g., illiteracy vs health outcomes).
   - Explore patterns and trends across regions and years.

8. **Data Visualization**
   - Use charts to illustrate key findings (bar charts, pie charts, histograms, line charts, heatmaps).
   - Compare variables visually.

9. **Insights & Findings**
   - Extract key results from the analysis.
   - Highlight significant patterns and observations.

10. **Recommendations**
    - Suggest improvements or interventions based on findings.
    - Connect insights to policy or social actions.

## Key Questions Addressed
- Relationship between education (literacy) level and health outcomes.
- Are areas with higher illiteracy experiencing worse health indicators?
- Distribution of begging across governorates and years.
- Correlation between addiction rates and divorce rates.
- Average rate of each issue per governorate.
- Impact of governorate-level education on addiction or begging rates.
- Population percentages in each risk category.
- Differences between urban vs rural areas (if available).
- Link between begging cases and poverty/unemployment indicators.
- Factors influencing health and social vulnerability.
- Co-occurrence of social issues (e.g., addiction and divorce).
- Interaction between education, health, and social vulnerability.
- Differences across age groups.
- Overall distribution of each issue nationwide.
