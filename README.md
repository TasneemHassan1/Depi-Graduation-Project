# Social Issues in Egypt Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes five major social issues in Egypt: **Illiteracy, Women & Divorce Issues, Homelessness, Addiction, and Public Health challenges**.  

Inspired by **Egypt’s Vision 2030** and the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, the project explores how these issues have evolved, identifies root causes, and visualizes the findings interactively using **Power BI**. The analysis contributes to strategic goals such as **Quality Education, Gender Equality, Good Health & Well-Being, No Poverty, and Sustainable Cities & Communities**.

The project workflow included:
- Collecting diverse datasets
- Conducting a public survey
- Cleaning and preparing the data
- Building a robust data model
- Designing full interactive dashboards in light and dark themes

---

## 1. Data Collection
Data was gathered from multiple sources:
- Online sources, government portals, open-data websites, research reports, and statistical platforms
- Public survey to collect citizens’ opinions on the five social issues

The survey helped understand public awareness, perceptions, and urgency of the issues.

---

## 2. Data Cleaning
Each dataset was cleaned using **Excel, Power Query, and Python**. Cleaning steps included:
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Standardizing columns
- Fixing incorrect data types
- Removing duplicates
- Preparing data for modeling and visualization

---

## 3. Data Modeling
Using **Power BI**, we created a professional data model:
- Designed a **star schema**
- Built **fact** and **dimension tables**
- Established relationships between tables
- Created calculated measures and KPIs
- Structured the model for drill-downs and filtering

---

## 4. Data Visualization
We built a full **Power BI reporting system** with multiple dashboards:

**Main Navigation Page:**  
Central home page linking all dashboards

**Overview Dashboard:**  
- Summarizes all five issues
- Multi-year trends and cross-issue comparisons

**KPI Dashboard:**  
- Top KPIs, governorate comparisons, yearly trends, highlighted anomalies

**Individual Issue Dashboards:**  
- **Illiteracy / Education**  
- **Women & Divorce**  
- **Homelessness / Begging**  
- **Addiction**  
- **Healthcare**

**Survey Dashboard:**  
- Shows public survey results for direct insights

**Features:**  
- Light & Dark modes  
- Drill-down and drill-through  
- Hover tooltips  
- Dynamic filters & slicers  
- Natural-language Q&A visual  
- Buttons & bookmarks for smooth navigation  
- Embedded awareness videos  
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for user-specific data access

---

## 5. K-Means Clustering Model
We implemented an **unsupervised machine learning model (K-Means)** to group governorates based on:
- Risk levels
- Social indicators
- Health metrics
- Education levels
- Addiction and homelessness patterns

Visualization includes:
- Maps showing geographical distribution
- Cluster summary tables with characteristics of each group

This helped identify high-risk governorates and revealed hidden patterns to support data-driven decisions.

---

## Analytical Questions Explored
Some key questions addressed:
- Trends and peak years for divorce, homelessness, and addiction
- Governorates with highest rates for each issue
- Distribution across urban/rural areas and age groups
- Education indicators: literacy rate, enrollment, dropout, gender gap
- Public perceptions on societal problems and their causes
- Risk and stability analysis for different issues
- Overall expected worsening trends

---

## Overall Summary
This project provides a **comprehensive analysis of critical social challenges in Egypt**, combining official datasets, public perceptions, and advanced analytics such as K-Means clustering.  

The **interactive dashboards and data models**:
- Reveal hidden patterns and trends
- Support informed decision-making
- Raise awareness about key social issues

The project aligns with **Egypt’s Vision 2030** and **UN SDGs**, demonstrating how **data analytics can guide sustainable development solutions**.
