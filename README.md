# Social Issues in Egypt Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes five major social issues in Egypt: **Illiteracy, Women & Divorce Issues, Homelessness, Addiction, and Public Health challenges**.  

Inspired by **Egypt’s Vision 2030** and the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, the project explores how these issues have evolved, identifies root causes, and visualizes the findings interactively using **Power BI**.  

---

## 1. Data Collection
Data was gathered from multiple sources:
- Online sources, government portals, open-data websites, research reports, and statistical platforms
- Public survey to collect citizens’ opinions on the five social issues

---

## 2. Data Cleaning
Each dataset was cleaned using Excel, Power Query, and Python. Cleaning steps included:
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Standardizing columns
- Fixing incorrect data types
- Removing duplicates

---

## 3. Data Modeling
Using Power BI, we created a professional data model:
- Designed a Snowflake schema
- Built fact and dimension tables
- Established relationships between tables
- Created calculated measures and KPIs

---

## 4. Data Visualization
Dashboards include:
- **Main Navigation Page**
- **Overview Dashboard** – multi-year trends, cross-issue comparisons
- **KPI Dashboard** – top KPIs, governorate comparisons, anomalies
- **Individual Issue Dashboards** – Illiteracy, Women & Divorce, Homelessness, Addiction, Healthcare
- **Survey Dashboard** – public survey insights  

Features:
- Light & Dark modes  
- Drill-down and drill-through  
- Dynamic filters & slicers  
- Natural-language Q&A visual  
- Embedded awareness videos  
- Row-Level Security (RLS)

## 5. Machine Learning Models
1-K-Means Clustering Model
Grouped governorates based on:
- Risk levels, social indicators, health metrics, education, addiction, homelessness  

Visualizations include maps and cluster summary tables.

2- Time Series Forcasting Model
We used Time Series Analysis with Facebook Prophet to forecast six major social issues in Egypt up to 2030. Cleaned annual data (2018–2023) was used to identify trends and generate forecasts for 2024–2030. Results were analyzed, classified by trend severity, and visualized to support data-driven decision-making.

## Analytical Questions Explored
- Trends and peak years for divorce, homelessness, addiction  
- Governorates with highest rates for each issue  
- Education indicators: literacy rate, enrollment, dropout, gender gap  
- Public perceptions on societal problems  
- Risk and stability analysis  

---
