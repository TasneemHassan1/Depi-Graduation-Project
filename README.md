# Social Issues in Egypt Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes five major social issues in Egypt: **Illiteracy, Women & Divorce Issues, Homelessness, Addiction, and Public Health challenges**.  

Inspired by **Egypt’s Vision 2030** and the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, the project explores how these issues have evolved, identifies root causes, and visualizes the findings interactively using **Power BI**.

## 1. Data Collection
Data was gathered from multiple sources:
- Online sources, government portals, open-data websites, research reports, and statistical platforms
- Public survey to collect citizens’ opinions on the five social issues

---

## 2. Data Cleaning
Each dataset was cleaned using Excel, Power Query, and Python. Cleaning steps included:
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Standardizing columns
- Fixing incorrect data types
- Removing duplicates

---

## 3. Data Modeling
Using Power BI, we created a professional data model:
- Designed a star schema
- Built fact and dimension tables
- Established relationships between tables
- Created calculated measures and KPIs

---

## 4. Data Visualization
Dashboards include:
- **Main Navigation Page**
- **Overview Dashboard** – multi-year trends, cross-issue comparisons
- **KPI Dashboard** – top KPIs, governorate comparisons, anomalies
- **Individual Issue Dashboards** – Illiteracy, Women & Divorce, Homelessness, Addiction, Healthcare
- **Survey Dashboard** – public survey insights  

Features:
- Light & Dark modes  
- Drill-down and drill-through  
- Dynamic filters & slicers  
- Natural-language Q&A visual  
- Embedded awareness videos  
- Row-Level Security (RLS)

## 5. K-Means Clustering Model
Grouped governorates based on:
- Risk levels, social indicators, health metrics, education, addiction, homelessness  

Visualizations include maps and cluster summary tables.

---

## Analytical Questions Explored
- Trends and peak years for divorce, homelessness, addiction  
- Governorates with highest rates for each issue  
- Education indicators: literacy rate, enrollment, dropout, gender gap  
- Public perceptions on societal problems  
- Risk and stability analysis
